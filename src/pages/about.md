Hola! I'm Michelle üë©üèª‚Äçüíª *(she/her)*

My work lies at the intersection of **applied research** and **engineering products that scale**, transforming advances in **Computer Vision** and **Large Language Models** into high-impact, real-world systems. I focus on rapid prototyping, designing novel experiments, and deploying state-of-the-art solutions.

I have a proven track record of architecting scalable ML frameworks, building cutting-edge CV and RAG systems, and leading cross-functional teams to deliver measurable impact.

### What I'm into
- **Machine Learning**: model design, evaluation, deployment and safety.
- **Computer Vision**: especially **3D vision** and new ways of seeing the world. 
- **Robotics**: no longer actively involved, but I used to compete internationally and lead a robotics community. 
- **Sports**: from running and hiking to the occasional swim.
- **Taekwondo**: former high-performance athlete and **national medallist**.
- **Photography**: not a professional, but I love capturing the moment, especially in nature.
- **Books**: from ML papers to fiction detours.
- **Tacos**: fuel for life üåÆ

### Community
I've co-founded and led communities with **thousands of members** across LATAM, from AI education in Spanish to mentoring women in tech and even international robotics competitions.
